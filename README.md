# LeapYear

What is a leap year? It takes approximately 365.25 days for Earth to orbit the Sun â€” a solar year. We usually round the days in a calendar year to 365. To make up for the missing partial day, we add one day to our calendar approximately every four years, those years where we have an extra day are considered leap years.
